# Sieve of Eratosthenes
Parallel Sieve of Eratosthenes for Finding All Prime Numbers within 10^10

## Objective
Modifying the parallel Sieve of Eratosthenes to find primes numbers more efficiently and cost effectively.
1. Original Sieve of Eratosthenes
2. Avoid using memory for even numbers
3. Each process find its own sieving primes via local computations (not broadcasts)
4. More effective use of caches

## Instructions
Use the command `make` to start up the command line interface and follow directions to test different algorithsm.
